New And Improved
===
This project is meant as a rethinking of the render engine and module renderer
architecture. The goal is to be completely backwards compatible with the
existing components, but to be easier to develop, a lot more responsive, a lot
more scalable, and a lot faster.

Getting Started
---
One of our most important goals is for this project to be easy to develop for.
To accomplish this goal, we have chosen to use Vagrant and Chef to allow
developers to setup a working environment as quickly as possible.

If you don't have vagrant yet, you'll have to install these. It is available as
a ruby gem. See [Vagrant Getting Started](http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/index.html)

To setup the project simply:

	git clone
	vagrant up
